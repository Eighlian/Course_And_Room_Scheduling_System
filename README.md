# Course_And_Room_Scheduling_System


The goal of this project is to create a software that will schedule courses to rooms and add students to 

each. The software that we have built uses a GUI to show the connection between databases, courses, and 

rooms. There are two databases one for storing courses and another for storing rooms. The databases are 

connected to using SQL a “structured query language”. The databases are changed in a CRUD manner, create, 

updated, manage, and delete. We first load information to the database using file I/O with excel spreadsheets. 

This is meant to simulate already existing information.


The Software has a main purpose and that is to keep scheduling rooms, courses, and students very 

simple and easy. This is the goal that we have set out to achieve with our program. The program will allow many 

methods to change and view the information that is needed. This goal that we have set out to complete kept the

group on track through the entire project life cycle.
